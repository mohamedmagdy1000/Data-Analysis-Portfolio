# Data-Analysis-Portfolio

This repository is a starter template for your Data Analysis learning journey. It contains a small sample dataset, SQL scripts used for importing and checking data, and notes for next steps.

## What is inside
- `customers_orders.xlsx` — small example dataset (customers + orders) to practice SQL and Sheets.
- `staging_schema.sql` — SQL to create a staging table for census/population import.
- `01_import_and_checks.sql` — basic import checks and first queries to run after import.
- `.gitignore` — recommended ignore file for development.
- `sample_commit_messages.txt` — examples of commit messages to use.
- `README.md` — (this file).

## How to use
1. Create a new GitHub repository (e.g. `Data-Analysis-Portfolio`).  
2. Clone it locally or upload files via GitHub web UI.  
3. If you use git locally, example commands:
```bash
git init
git add README.md staging_schema.sql 01_import_and_checks.sql customers_orders.xlsx .gitignore
git commit -m "chore: initial repo with sample data and import scripts"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/Data-Analysis-Portfolio.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Next steps
- Replace `customers_orders.xlsx` with your census CSV (or add both: sample + full).  
- Add a `projects/` folder for each project with analysis scripts, queries, and screenshots/dashboards.
- Add a clear `README.md` per project describing the problem, data source, approach, key findings and how to run.

If you want, I can prepare project-specific README and SQL scripts (e.g. `census-egypt/README.md`) — tell me which project to scaffold next and I'll generate the files for you.
